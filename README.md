# NZGOAL-Software
This project is for consultation on the draft extension to the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) framework to incorporate guidance to agencies on the licensing of publicly funded software. This is so public software assets can be reused to enable more efficient maintenance and improvement as well as being building blocks that can accelerate innovation.
